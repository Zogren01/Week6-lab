**Code of Conduct**

The code of conduct effects all contributors to this project when making pull requests. 

The goal of our project is to have the bare minimum amount of code in order to complete our class assignment, and addition of unnecessary code is strictly prohibited.

Use of profane language is also prohibited, due to the nature of the assignment.

Violation of the code of conduct will lead to a single warning, followed by a week suspension from the project. Any further violations will be dealt with through a permanent removal of the guilty contributors from the project.
